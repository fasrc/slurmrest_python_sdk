## Example

```python
from slurmrest_python_0_0_41.models.v0041_openapi_diag_resp_statistics import V0041OpenapiDiagRespStatistics

# TODO update the JSON string below
json = "{}"
# create an instance of V0041OpenapiDiagRespStatistics from a JSON string
v0041_openapi_diag_resp_statistics_instance = V0041OpenapiDiagRespStatistics.from_json(json)
# print the JSON string representation of the object
print(V0041OpenapiDiagRespStatistics.to_json())

# convert the object into a dict
